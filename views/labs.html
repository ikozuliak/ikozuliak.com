                Woohoo! Day 100 has arrived. We can hardly believe it. So much has happened in a mere three months that
                it’s
                hard to
                process it. But, we can say that we could never have imagined just how amazing the past 100 Days have
                been.
                We’ve
                talked a lot about how humbled we are by the graciousness and willingness of these, talented, genuine,
                brilliant
                designers and entrepreneurs to take the time to talk with us. We just want to reiterate, that it’s not
                just
                talk. We
                are truly thankful that they’ve been so amazingly open with their answers, and truly excited to be a
                part of
                Kern
                and Burn.
